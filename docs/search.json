New Zealand (NZ) reported 6 mt of recent period pole-and-line SPA catch. French Polynesia (PF) reported 16 mt of recent period pole-and-line and 208 mt of other SPA catch. Papua New Guinea (PG) reported 6 mt of recent period purse seine SPA catch. Solomon Islands (SB) reported 1 mt of recent period purse seine SPA catch.↩︎\nFishery is defined as a unique combination of CCM and gear type.↩︎\nMaximum cuts and increases assume that future allocation reflects recent average catch over the period 2020-2022.↩︎\nNote for the purposes of this summary, the disputed maritime region of Matthew & Hunter (jointly claimed by New Caledonia and Vanuatu) was omitted from the analysis. Negligible catches were observed in this region.↩︎",

Follow the in terminal prompts to install all packages. This should take a few minutes as there are a number of packages to load. If renv does not bootstrap automatically then run:\nrenv::restore()\n\n\nUsing an integrated development environment (IDE)\nUsers using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code can configure set-up with R version 4.4.0 (set-up instructions here). In order to configure Visual Studio Code to work with renv the user should follow the configuration steps located here. Once Visual Studio Code has been configured properly, open the 2024-WCPFC21-analysis folder using Visual Studio Code. Opening an R terminal should prompt the renv package to bootstrap itself as described above. If renv does not bootstrap automatically then run:\nrenv::restore()\nIf using an alternative IDE such as Rstudio the R environment set-up will be very similar to the process described for Visual Studio Code.",
